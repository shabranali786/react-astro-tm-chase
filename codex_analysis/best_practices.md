# Language-Specific Best Practices Analysis

## Astro Framework Best Practices

### Adhered Practices
1. **Proper component structure**: Using Astro's component format with `---` delimiters for frontmatter
2. **Layout usage**: Properly implementing Astro layouts with the `<slot />` mechanism
3. **Static asset handling**: Using Astro's `Image` and `Picture` components for optimized images
4. **Client-side interactivity**: Using `is:inline` directive for scripts that need to run on the client
5. **Integration with React**: Properly using `@astrojs/react` integration for React components

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Partial hydration**: Not maximizing Astro's island architecture pattern - most components are fully static
2. **Build optimization**: Using `inlineStylesheets: "auto"` in config is good, but more CSS optimization could be implemented
3. **Asset optimization**: Some images are external URLs rather than optimized via Astro's asset pipeline
4. **TypeScript usage**: The project has TypeScript enabled but not fully leveraging its benefits in components

## JavaScript/JSX Best Practices

### Adhered Practices
1. **Module imports**: Proper ES module syntax for imports
2. **React component structure**: Using functional components with JSX
3. **Modern JavaScript features**: Using ES6+ syntax where appropriate

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Code splitting**: Swiper initialization in component creates potentially large bundle
2. **React component naming**: Simple component structure could be enhanced with better naming and organization
3. **Prop validation**: No prop validation in React components (could use TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes)

## HTML Best Practices

### Adhered Practices
1. **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic elements
2. **Accessibility attributes**: Using proper ARIA attributes where needed
3. **Alt text for images**: Good alt text usage in image components

### Areas for Improvement
1. **HTML structure**: Some complex nested div structures could be improved with semantic elements
2. **Accessibility**: More ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support could be added

## CSS/Tailwind Best Practices

### Adhered Practices
1. **Utility-first approach**: Using Tailwind classes extensively
2. **Responsive design**: Proper use of responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:, 4xl:)
3. **Dark mode support**: Configured in tailwind.config.js with darkMode: "class"

### Areas for Improvement
1. **CSS class reuse**: Some long class strings that could benefit from component-level abstraction
2. **Custom CSS**: Some custom classes (like btn-primary, section-title) without clear source files
3. **Performance**: Large class strings in JSX could impact bundle size and readability

## Performance Best Practices

### Adhered Practices
1. **Image optimization**: Using Astro's image optimization features
2. **Font optimization**: Using Google Fonts with proper optimization in config
3. **Script management**: Using `is:inline` appropriately for client scripts

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Critical CSS**: Could benefit from more critical CSS inlining
2. **Loading strategies**: No explicit loading strategies for images or components
3. **Bundle analysis**: No clear mechanism to analyze and monitor bundle sizes

## Security Best Practices

### Areas for Concern
1. **External scripts**: Direct inclusion of external scripts without integrity checks
2. **Content Security Policy**: No CSP header configuration visible
3. **Input validation**: No user input handling visible, but would need validation if added

## Internationalization Best Practices

### Observations
- No internationalization framework implemented
- Content appears to be English-only
- No locale-specific routing or content management
