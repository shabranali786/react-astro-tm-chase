# Design Patterns Analysis

## Current Design Patterns Identified

1. **Component-Based Architecture Pattern**:
   - The project uses Astro's component system extensively with `.astro` files
   - Components like `HeroSection.astro`, `BrandRegister.astro`, `OfferSlider.astro` follow a modular approach
   - Layout components (`Layout.astro`, `Header.astro`) provide template structure

2. **Layout Pattern**:
   - Utilizes Astro's layout system with default and custom layouts
   - Web and LP (landing page) layouts in separate directories (`src/layouts/web` and `src/layouts/lp`)
   - Layouts use slots to inject page content

3. **Hybrid Rendering Pattern**:
   - Combines server-side rendering (SSR) with client-side interactions
   - Uses Astro's partial hydration for interactive components
   - Includes React component integration via `@astrojs/react` integration

## Missing Design Patterns

1. **No explicit architectural pattern** (MVC, MVP, MVVM, etc.) as these are more common in traditional web frameworks
2. **No dependency injection pattern** - dependencies are imported directly
3. **No state management patterns** - the project appears to be content-heavy without complex state management

## Recommended Design Patterns for Enhancement

1. **State Management Pattern** (Context/Provider Pattern):
   - For managing application state across components
   - Could use Astro's integration with React context or other state management libraries

2. **Container/Presentational Pattern**:
   - Separate data-fetching components from UI-presentational components
   - Would improve modularity and testability

3. **Configuration/Settings Pattern**:
   - Define constants for API URLs, environment settings in a central configuration file
   - Would improve maintainability

4. **Template Method Pattern**:
   - For consistent page structure across different sections of the website
