# Code Consistency Analysis

## Naming Conventions

### Consistent Patterns
- Component names use PascalCase (e.g., `HeroSection.astro`, `BrandRegister.astro`)
- JavaScript/JSX files also follow PascalCase for component names (e.g., `demo.jsx`)
- CSS classes use kebab-case as per Tailwind convention (e.g., `section-title`, `btn-primary`)

### Inconsistent Patterns
- File organization: Some pages are in root (`index.astro`, `about.astro`) while others are in subdirectories (`lp/`, `posts/`)
- Component structure varies between Astro components with and without script sections
- Mix of inline styles and Tailwind utility classes without clear guidelines

## Code Formatting

### Consistent Patterns
- Proper indentation is maintained throughout the codebase
- Astro component structure follows the standard format with `---` delimiters for frontmatter
- Consistent use of self-closing tags for images and other void elements
- Proper HTML semantic structure is maintained

### Inconsistent Patterns
- Some components have comments in different styles (`//` and `<!-- -->`)
- Inline scripts in layout files don't follow consistent style
- Some Astro components have inconsistent spacing in attributes

## Modularity

### Strengths
- Clear separation between layouts, components, and pages
- Reusable components are well-defined and imported in pages
- Different layout systems for web and landing pages (`src/layouts/web` vs `src/layouts/lp`)

### Areas for Improvement
- Some components are too large and could be broken down into smaller sub-components
- No clear pattern for organizing React components alongside Astro components
- Repetitive code in header navigation dropdowns could be extracted to a reusable dropdown component

## Duplication

### Identified Duplications
- Similar dropdown structures in header component repeated across multiple sections
- Image handling patterns repeated in multiple components
- Styling classes often repeated across components without consistent class composition

## Error Handling

### Observations
- No explicit error handling patterns identified in the codebase
- Image loading is handled by Astro's built-in `Image` and `Picture` components
- No form validation or user input error handling visible in the analyzed components
- Third-party scripts (like chat widget) don't have error handling fallbacks

## Other Consistency Issues

1. **Asset Management**:
   - Some assets are in `src/assets` while others are referenced from external URLs
   - Mix of Astro's `Image` component and direct image tags in some places

2. **Script Integration**:
   - Swiper slider initialized in Astro component with direct script tag
   - External scripts added inline in layout files without consistent pattern

3. **Class Naming**:
   - Combination of custom CSS classes and Tailwind utility classes without clear distinction
   - Some custom classes like `btn-primary`, `section-title` suggest custom CSS exists but pattern is inconsistent
